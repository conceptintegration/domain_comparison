"Voting age population. The voting age population (VAP) includes all citizens above the legal voting age. VAP figures can complement voter registration figures for two reasons. First, registration figures can be inaccurate or unavailable, and sometimes voter registers are not used (as in South Africa in 1994). Second, the voting age population figures can provide a clearer picture of participation as they signal a problem with the voters' register or registration system. The voting age population is based on a country's population over the age of 18. It is not intended to be an exact measure of the number of citizens entitled to vote as it does not take into account legal or systemic barriers to the exercise of the franchise or account for non-eligible members of the population, such as resident non-citizens (the voting eligible population - VEP - would capture these discrepancies but it is very hard to achieve the data required to measure VEP). It is intended as indicative only. For elections held between 1945 and 2001, most estimates of the VAP data are based on the latest census data report in the Demographic Yearbook 1998. This data is produced by the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Estimates for Barbados, the Central African Republic and Niger are based on census data reported in the Demographic Yearbook 1996. Estimates for Albania, Djibouti, Ghana, Guinea, Guyana, Côte d'Ivoire, Samoa, Tanzania, and Togo are based on the medium variant population estimate in World Population Prospects: the 1998 Revision Volume II. The following countries were not included in the statistics produced by the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs: Anguilla, Fiji, Grenada, Nauru and Palau. For these countries the CIA World Factbook has been used. In all cases the population data selected is either that for the election year or the latest reported before the election year. In the latter case the growth rates presented in table A11 of World Population Prospects: the 1998 Revision Volume 1 were applied to form an estimated population for the election year. For elections held 2002 and onwards the population figures are based on data from the International Database of the U.S. Census Bureau. For all election years, the data was then adjusted to remove population under the age of 18. The result forms our estimated voting age population. Again, the VAP figures are estimates and should be treated as such.",Chile_2021/1370,"The following may vote indistinctly for the candidates for general conventions of their district or indigenous candidates or candidates of their own town: a) the citizens identified by the Electoral Service as indigenous voters in accordance with the preceding paragraph; b) Citizens who, not appearing on said list, identify themselves as indigenous voters prior to the day of the election, obtaining an authorization from the Electoral Service for: 1.- proving their status as indigenous through a certificate from the National Development Corporation Indigenous who demonstrates their quality as such, or 2.- a sworn statement, prepared by the Electoral Service, where it is expressly indicated that the person declares that they meet any of the conditions established by law No. 19,253 to obtain indigenous status, granted before the following ministers of faith: notaries, municipal secretaries or the official to whom they delegate this function, official of the Civil Registry and Identification Service, National Indigenous Development Corporation, or directly before the Electoral Service, by in person or with a password only.
